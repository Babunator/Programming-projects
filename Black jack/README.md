### Blackjack:
- The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
- Played with decks of 52 cards
- To start each round, players place bets 
- Player gets an initial hand of two cards 
- The dealer's hand gets its first card face up
- Aces count as one OR eleven
- After the initial two cards, the player has up to five options: "hit", "stand", "double down", "split", or "surrender". 
  - Hit: Take another card.
  - Stand: Take no more cards; also known as "stand pat", "stick", or "stay".
  - Double down: You can also "double-down" after you have received your original hand from the dealer, This allows you to double your bet in return for taking exactly one more card from the dealer.
  - Split: A split is when your first two cards are the same (two queens, two fours and so on). You have the option to break the hand into two separate hands, and then you bet on each separately and the dealer gives you another card on each. 
  - Surrender: Forfeit half the bet and end the hand immediately. This option is only available at some tables in some casinos, and the option is only available as the first decision.
-  You can keep asking for more cards until you want to stop or your total hand's score exceeds 21. If you stop at or before 21, the dealer then draws their own cards to try and beat you.
-  You lose if you exceed 21 or the dealer gets closer to 21 than you do, or if the dealer ties you. You win if you get closer to 21 than the dealer does.
